# üß† MINDMASH Application: C Programming Series & Quizzes

This repository contains the front-end code for **MINDMASH**, an application designed by The Coders Club. It serves as a comprehensive platform for a C Programming Series, featuring structured weekly content, interactive quizzes, a feedback mechanism, and a dynamic leaderboard.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **C Programming Series Content (Homepage - `index.html`)**:
    * **Structured Weekly Content**: Navigate through C programming content organized by weeks.
    * **Daily Learning Modules**: Each week breaks down into daily sections (Monday, Tuesday, etc.), offering focused learning.
    * **Responsive Tab Navigation**: Week and day selection buttons are fully responsive, gracefully adapting to different screen sizes and maintaining a consistent, sleek appearance on both desktop and mobile devices.
    * **Code Snippets & Examples**: Content includes clearly formatted code blocks for hands-on learning.

* **Interactive Quiz Form (`quiz.html`)**:
    * Allows users to answer multiple-choice, multi-select, and open-ended questions.
    * Can be **enabled or disabled** via a simple JavaScript variable for active control.
    * **"Quiz Closed" Experience**: When disabled, quiz questions are **jumbled and blurred**, and input fields are inaccessible, providing clear visual feedback that it's currently unavailable.
    * **Anti-Copying Measures**: Basic CSS to prevent text selection in certain quiz elements when disabled.

* **Feedback Form (`feedback.html`)**:
    * Gathers valuable insights from users with various input types.
    * Can also be **enabled or disabled** for active control.

* **Dynamic Leaderboard Display (`leaderboard.html`)**:
    * **Weekly Tabs**: View quiz results categorized by different weeks, with **responsive navigation buttons** that adapt to screen size.
    * **Department-wise Filtering**: Within each week, results can be filtered by specific departments (e.g., CSE 2nd Year, CSE (AI/ML) 2nd Year, CSE 3rd Year), also with **responsive buttons**.
    * Clearly shows S.No., Name, and Score.
    * Highlights **disqualified rows** for easy identification.

* **Submission Success Animation**: A pleasant tick mark animation appears upon successful form submission for both quiz and feedback.

* **Google Sheets Integration**: Submits quiz and feedback form data directly to Google Sheets using a Google Apps Script web app (requires user setup).

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

### 1. Google Apps Script Setup (Backend for Data Submission)

Both the quiz and feedback forms submit data to a Google Sheet via a deployed Google Apps Script web app. You'll need to set this up first for submissions to work.

#### For each form (Quiz and Feedback):

1.  **Create a New Google Sheet**: Go to Google Sheets and create a new blank spreadsheet.
2.  **Rename the First Tab**: Rename the first tab (e.g., `Sheet1`) to match the expected column names for the respective form.
    * **For Quiz Form**: The first row of your Google Sheet should contain these column headers: `Name`, `Email`, `Department`, `Year`, `Question1`, `Question2`, `Question3`, `Question4`, `Question5`.
    * **For Feedback Form**: The first row of your Google Sheet should contain these column headers: `Name`, `Email`, `Department`, `Year`, `SatisfactionRating`, `LikedMost`, `Suggestions`, `Recommend`, `OtherComments`.
3.  **Open Apps Script**: In your Google Sheet, go to `Extensions > Apps Script`.
4.  **Paste the Script**: Delete any existing code (`Code.gs`) and paste the following Google Apps Script code. This is a generic script that will work for both forms, assuming your column headers match.

    ```javascript
    function doPost(e) {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
      var headers = sheet.getRange(1, 1, 1, sheet.getLastColumn()).getValues()[0];
      var rowData = [];

      // Add a timestamp as the first column (optional, but good practice)
      rowData.push(new Date());

      for (var i = 0; i < headers.length; i++) {
        var header = headers[i];
        if (header.toLowerCase() === 'timestamp') {
          // Skip if timestamp is already added
          continue;
        }
        var value = e.parameter[header];
        rowData.push(value || ''); // Add value, or empty string if not present
      }

      sheet.appendRow(rowData);

      return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({"result":"success", "row": sheet.getLastRow()})).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
    }
    ```
5.  **Deploy as Web App**:
    * Save the script (`File > Save project`).
    * Click `Deploy > New deployment`.
    * For "Select type," choose **Web app**.
    * For "Execute as," choose `Me`.
    * For "Who has access," choose `Anyone`.
    * Click `Deploy`.
    * **Copy the Web app URL**. This is crucial!

### 2. Frontend File Setup

1.  **Download/Clone**: Get all the HTML, CSS (`styles.css`), and image files (`TCC.png`, `MCE_tab.png`, `IG.png`, `LINKEDLN.png`, `YT.png`, `WP.svg`) from this repository.
2.  **Update Script URLs**:
    * Open `quiz.html` (for the Quiz form) in a text editor.
    * Find the line: `const scriptUrl = 'YOUR_QUIZ_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';`
    * Replace the placeholder URL with the **Web app URL** you copied from your Google Apps Script deployment for the Quiz form's Google Sheet.
    * Do the **same for `feedback.html`**, replacing its `scriptUrl` with the **Web app URL** for the Feedback form's Google Sheet.

### 3. Dynamic Form Status Control

* **For the Quiz form (`quiz.html`)**:
    * Open `quiz.html`.
    * Find the line: `const linkControlStatus = "disable";`
    * Change `"disable"` to `"enable"` to make the quiz form active.
* **For the Feedback form (`feedback.html`)**:
    * Open `feedback.html`.
    * Find the line: `const formControlStatus = "disable";`
    * Change `"disable"` to `"enable"` to make the feedback form active.

### 4. Leaderboard Data Management

The leaderboard data in `leaderboard.html` is currently **static HTML**. This means that to update the quiz scores, you will need to manually edit the `leaderboard.html` file.

* To update scores for a specific week, find the `div` with the corresponding `id` (e.g., `<div id="week1" ...>`).
* Within that, locate the specific department's `div` (e.g., `<div id="cse2_week1" ...>`).
* Edit the `<table>` rows (`<tr><td>...</td></tr>`) to reflect the latest rankings and scores.
* Follow the same process for other weeks and departments as needed.

## üíª Local Development

You can open `index.html`, `quiz.html`, `feedback.html`, and `leaderboard.html` directly in your web browser to test them. Remember that for form submissions to work, you *must* have completed the Google Apps Script setup and updated the `scriptUrl` in `quiz.html` and `feedback.html`.
